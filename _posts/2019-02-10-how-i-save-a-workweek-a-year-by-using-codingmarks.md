## Motivation
Finding the desired link can sometimes be a tedious job. It can even become frustrating
when you don't find it in a reasonable amount of time, because you know it's there somewhere, you visited it before... After a struggle of about
two or more minutes you finally find it.

You bookmark it this time and then you say to yourself - "_from now on I will be
more disciplined and consciously use bookmarks_".

> bookmark (verb) - record the address of (a website, file, etc.) to enable quick access in future.

So far, so good. The problem is your bookmarks can turn into a monster themselves and you can later lose then more time browsing through them
to find it, because you know you bookmarked it...

> Soon the bookmarks toolbar won't fit into your 4k wide monitor and on top of that the search function in most browser bookmark managers is suboptimal

Eventually you say "_F*ck that, Google knows everything about me anyway, so I'll just google it when I need it_". It usually works
most of the time, all the privacy issues taken into account, but what about those intranet links or not google searchable resources?
 In most cases the searches are horrific, at least with the companies and tools I worked with until now...

Well, out of these frustrations plus my wish to learn development with the MEAN stack, I have built [www.codingmarks.org](https://www.codingmarks.org). It helps me 
manage my programming and work related bookmarks more efficiently, that is 40 hours plus a year more efficiently...

## The time/frustrations saving
Now to the subject of this post, how can I save a workweek a year just by using codingmarks? 

Well my computations are simple. It noramlly takes 30 seconds or more to look for a link the "traditional" way, and I do that 
at least 20 times a day. With codingmarks it takes about 10 seconds, so I get a time saving of around 20 * 20 / 60 = 6.66 minutes a day.
Over a year's time this translates to around __40+ hours of saved time__.

> Not to mention the saved frustrations, this is priceless...

To achieve that I use tags and descriptions to exactly identify the resources I am looking for. Some of the features I use
most are :
  * custom searches
  * history
