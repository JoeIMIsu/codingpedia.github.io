title: How I save a workweek a year by using codingmarks
description: "Finding a desired link, you already visited, can be a tedious job and sometimes even frustrating.
 It normally takes 30 seconds or more to look for a link the traditional way, and I do that at least 20 times a day.
  With codingmarks.org it takes about 10 seconds, so I get a time saving of around 20 * 20 / 60 = 6.66 minutes a day.
   Over a year's time this translates to around 40+ hours of saved time."

## Motivation
Finding the desired link again can be sometimes a tedious job. It can even become frustrating
when you don't find it in a reasonable amount of time, because you know it's there somewhere, you visited it before... After a struggle of about
two or more minutes you finally find it.

This time you bookmark it  and then you say to yourself - "_from now on I will be
more disciplined and consciously use bookmarks_".

> bookmark (verb) - record the address of (a website, file, etc.) to enable quick access in future.

So far, so good. The problem is your bookmarks can turn into a monster themselves and you can later lose then more time browsing through them
to find the right one, because you know now you bookmarked it...

> Soon the bookmarks toolbar won't fit into your 4k wide monitor anymore and on top of that the search function in most browser bookmark managers is "suboptimal"

Eventually you say "_F*ck that, Google knows everything about me anyway, so I'll just google it when I need it_". It usually works
most of the time, all the privacy issues taken into account, but what about those intranet links or not google searchable resources?
 In most cases the (internal) searches are horrific, at least this was the experiences I had with companies and tools I worked with until now...

Well, out of these frustrations plus my wish to learn development with the MEAN stack, I have built [www.codingmarks.org](https://www.codingmarks.org). It helps me 
manage my programming and work related bookmarks more efficiently, like 40 hours plus a year more efficiently...

## How is this possbile?
Now to the subject of this post, how can I save a workweek a year just by using codingmarks? 

Well my computations are simple. It normally takes 30 seconds or more to look for a link the "traditional" way, and I do that 
at least 20 times a day. With codingmarks it takes about 10 seconds, so I get a time saving of around 20 * 20 / 60 = 6.66 minutes a day.
Over a year's time this translates to around __40+ hours of saved time__.

> Not to mention the saved frustrations, that is priceless...

To achieve that I use tags and descriptions to exactly identify the resources I am looking for. Some of the features I use
most are :
  * tagging
  * custom searches
  * history

Check out the following video to see how I usually use [codingmarks.org](https://www.codingmarks.org):
