## api 

**[API Infrastructure at Knewton: What’s in an Edge Service?](https://medium.com/knerd/api-infrastructure-at-knewton-whats-in-an-edge-service-51a3777aeb41)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2016-05-09
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [api](https://www.bookmarks.dev/search?q=[api]), &nbsp; [microservices](https://www.bookmarks.dev/search?q=[microservices]), &nbsp; [nginx](https://www.bookmarks.dev/search?q=[nginx]), &nbsp; [zuul](https://www.bookmarks.dev/search?q=[zuul])

In this post, we will pull back the covers of our API to explain how we handle user requests. You will first learn how to build an edge service with Netflix Zuul, the framework we chose for its simplicity and flexibility. Then, we’ll dive into the Knewton edge service to show you how it improves API simplicity, flexibility, and performance.

What’s in an Edge Service
-------
An edge service is a component which is exposed to the public internet. It acts as a gateway to all other services, which we will refer to as platform services. For example, consider an Nginx reverse proxy in front of some web resource servers. Here, Nginx acts as an edge service by routing public HTTP requests to the appropriate platform service.

**[The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2012-08-13
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [architecture](https://www.bookmarks.dev/search?q=[architecture])

Over the last several years we’ve seen a whole range of ideas regarding the architecture of systems. These include:

* [Hexagonal Architecture ](http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture)(a.k.a. Ports and Adapters) by Alistair Cockburn and adopted by Steve Freeman, and Nat Pryce in their wonderful book Growing Object Oriented Software
* [Onion Architecture](http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/) by Jeffrey Palermo
* [Screaming Architecture](http://blog.cleancoders.com/2011-09-30-Screaming-Architecture) from a blog of mine last year
* [DCI](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Architecture-Agile-Software-Development/dp/0470684208/) from James Coplien, and Trygve Reenskaug.
* [BCE](http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Software-Engineering-Approach/dp/0201544350) by Ivar Jacobson from his book Object Oriented Software Engineering: A Use-Case Driven Approach

Though these architectures all vary somewhat in their details, they are very similar. They all have the same objective, which is the separation of concerns. They all achieve this separation by dividing the software into layers. Each has at least one layer for business rules, and another for interfaces.

The diagram at the top of this article is an attempt at integrating all these architectures into a single actionable idea.

**[Strategic Domain Driven Design with Context Mapping](https://www.infoq.com/articles/ddd-contextmapping)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2009-11-25
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [domain-driven-design](https://www.bookmarks.dev/search?q=[domain-driven-design]), &nbsp; [architecture](https://www.bookmarks.dev/search?q=[architecture])

Many approaches to object oriented modeling tend not to scale well when the applications grow in size and complexity. **Context Mapping** technique can be used to manage the complexity in large software development projects. In this article, author Alberto Brandolini discusses the many sides of **bounded contexts** and how to use them to build a context map to support key decisions in a software project.

"_Code is the primary form of expression of the model. Although other artifacts might be necessary along the way to capture requirements or portions of the design, the only one that'll be constantly in sync with the application behavior is code itself._"

"_Trying to set up a partnership without a collaborative environment, is clearly a dead end strategy._"

## chai 

**[Modern Node.js: async/await based testing with Mocha & Chai](https://zaiste.net/modern_node_js_async_await_based_testing_with_mocha_chai/)**

  * <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> **published on**: &nbsp;2017-04-09
  * **tags**: &nbsp; [mocha](https://www.bookmarks.dev/search?q=[mocha]), &nbsp; [chai](https://www.bookmarks.dev/search?q=[chai]), &nbsp; [testing](https://www.bookmarks.dev/search?q=[testing])
  * <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> [github url](https://zaiste.net/modern_node_js_async_await_based_testing_with_mocha_chai/)

Mocha is a JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser. It can run both asynchronous and synchronous code serially. Test cases are created using describe() and it() methods, the former is used to provide a structure by allowing to put various tests cases in logical groups while the latter is where the tests are written.

In order to perform actual tests, there is a need for an assertion library: a runtime mechanism which can be used to verify assumptions made by the program and print a diagnostic message if this assumption is false. Node.js comes with a built-in assert library. Chai is another popular assertion library that provides both the BDD and TDD styles of programming for testing the code. BDD stands for Behavior-driven development while TDD stands for Test-driven development. In a nutshell, Chai provides a should keyword for BDD style which allows to chain assertions and an expect() method for TDD style. Choosing between one and another is a matter of personal preference.

Then, we’ll dive into the Knewton edge service to show you how it improves API simplicity, flexibility, and performance.

What’s in an Edge Service
-------
An edge service is a component which is exposed to the public internet. It acts as a gateway to all other services, which we will refer to as platform services. For example, consider an Nginx reverse proxy in front of some web resource servers. Here, Nginx acts as an edge service by routing public HTTP requests to the appropriate platform service.

  * <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> [github url](https://zaiste.net/modern_node_js_async_await_based_testing_with_mocha_chai/)

Mocha is a JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser. It can run both asynchronous and synchronous code serially. Test cases are created using describe() and it() methods, the former is used to provide a structure by allowing to put various tests cases in logical groups while the latter is where the tests are written.

In order to perform actual tests, there is a need for an assertion library: a runtime mechanism which can be used to verify assumptions made by the program and print a diagnostic message if this assumption is false. Node.js comes with a built-in assert library. Chai is another popular assertion library that provides both the BDD and TDD styles of programming for testing the code. BDD stands for Behavior-driven development while TDD stands for Test-driven development. In a nutshell, Chai provides a should keyword for BDD style which allows to chain assertions and an expect() method for TDD style. Choosing between one and another is a matter of personal preference.

Open Source has always been a foundation of the Internet, and with the advent of social open source networks this is more true than ever. But free, libre, and open source projects suffer from a startling lack of diversity, with dramatically low representation by women, people of color, and other marginalized populations.

Often it is the unintentional assumptions and actions of project maintainers and participants that make open source projects unwelcoming (or even hostile) to marginalized people: making assumptions about gender or race, reinforcing stereotypes, using sexualized or otherwise inappropriate language, or demonstrating a lack of regard for the safety and well-being of vulnerable people.

One way to begin addressing this problem is to be overt in our openness, welcoming all people to contribute, and pledging in return to value them as whole human beings and to foster an atmosphere of kindness, cooperation, and understanding.

Adopting the Contributor Covenant can be one way to express and codify these values and signal your intention to make your open source community welcoming, diverse, and inclusive.

  * <i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i> [github url](https://zaiste.net/modern_node_js_async_await_based_testing_with_mocha_chai/)

Mocha is a JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser. It can run both asynchronous and synchronous code serially. Test cases are created using describe() and it() methods, the former is used to provide a structure by allowing to put various tests cases in logical groups while the latter is where the tests are written.

In order to perform actual tests, there is a need for an assertion library: a runtime mechanism which can be used to verify assumptions made by the program and print a diagnostic message if this assumption is false. Node.js comes with a built-in assert library. Chai is another popular assertion library that provides both the BDD and TDD styles of programming for testing the code. BDD stands for Behavior-driven development while TDD stands for Test-driven development. In a nutshell, Chai provides a should keyword for BDD style which allows to chain assertions and an expect() method for TDD style. Choosing between one and another is a matter of personal preference.

In this post, we will pull back the covers of our API to explain how we handle user requests. You will first learn how to build an edge service with Netflix Zuul, the framework we chose for its simplicity and flexibility. Then, we’ll dive into the Knewton edge service to show you how it improves API simplicity, flexibility, and performance.

What’s in an Edge Service
-------
An edge service is a component which is exposed to the public internet. It acts as a gateway to all other services, which we will refer to as platform services. For example, consider an Nginx reverse proxy in front of some web resource servers. Here, Nginx acts as an edge service by routing public HTTP requests to the appropriate platform service.
